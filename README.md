In this project I attempt to create a predictive model that helps the impact team at Generation understand program impact on job outcomes for their alumni. 

Generation is an employment nonprofit that transforms education to employment systems and supports people into life-changing careers.

Every year, Generation surveys its alumni to gauge the program's impact on their careers and financial well-being.  This analysis looks into the factors influencing graduates' job attainment success after  their completion of Generationâ€™s training program. We focus on this metric as it marks a pivotal transition point for program graduates and represents the first tangible measure of success.
